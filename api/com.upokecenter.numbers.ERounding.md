# com.upokecenter.numbers.ERounding

    public enum ERounding extends Enum<ERounding>

Specifies the mode to use when &#x22;shortening&#x22; numbers that otherwise
 can&#x27;t fit a given number of digits, so that the shortened number
 has about the same value. This &#x22;shortening&#x22; is known as
 rounding. (The "E" stands for "extended", and has this prefix to
 group it with the other classes common to this library, particularly
 EDecimal, EFloat, and ERational.).
